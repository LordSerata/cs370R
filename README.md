Reflection

What work did I do?
I was given starter code with the maze environment and some incomplete functions. I added the reinforcement learning logic, built the training loop with replay memory, and fixed bugs with game status and training speed.

What do computer scientists do?
Computer scientists solve problems by designing algorithms and systems that make tasks easier and more efficient. This matters because it drives progress in areas like automation, AI, and data analysis.

How do I approach problems?
I break problems down into smaller parts, test often, and improve step by step. For this project, I focused on getting the agent to run correctly before improving efficiency and performance.

What are my ethical responsibilities?
I need to make sure the code is reliable, safe, and transparent. In real-world systems, that means preventing harm, reducing bias, and writing clear, maintainable solutions for both users and organizations.
